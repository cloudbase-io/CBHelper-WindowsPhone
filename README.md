BHelper-WindowsPhone
=====================

The cloudbase.io Windows Phone helper class

The Visual Studio 2012 solution contains two projects
- CBHelper - the actual helper class which compiles to a dll library
- CloudbaseTestApp - A demo application. This depends on the dll generated by the CBHelper project

The cloudbase.io helper class for Windows Phone utilizes the Newtonsoft.Json package. While this package
is included in the solution you can get new updates and fixes using NuGet
